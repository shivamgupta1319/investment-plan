FinPilot: Your Interactive Financial Journey
FinPilot is a single-page, interactive web application designed to translate a comprehensive investment plan into a personalized, hands-on experience for a young investor. It visualizes the power of disciplined long-term investing through Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) and Systematic Withdrawal Plans (SWPs).

The application is built with vanilla HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, using Chart.js for dynamic data visualizations. It is fully self-contained in a single index.html file, making it incredibly easy to deploy on any static hosting service.
